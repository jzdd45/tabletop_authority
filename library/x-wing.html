        <h3>Star Wars: X-Wing Miniatures Game</h3>
        <p>X-Wing pits iconic and beloved Star Wars characters and ships together in an amazing dog-fighting strategy game. The game is easy to learn, the mechanics are very versatile and fun while still staying very true to the universe we all know and love. There are numerous expansions that add many new mechanics and ships to the game which keeps it fresh and interesting.</p>

        <h4>My review:</h4>
        <p>Although it is a bit on the expensive side once you get into the expansions (which you will), the sheer detail of the models and consistent quality of the components, along with the addictive nature of the gameplay which feels like a real dog-fight if it were a TableTop game, that is, will keep you occupied for days. Rating: 8/10</p>
