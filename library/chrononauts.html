        <h3>Chrononauts</h3>
        <p>Chrononauts is competative time traveling adventure that has you racing the clock (pun intended) to beat your opponent's victory. The game features a series of timeline cards that can be affected by the cards in the draw pile to change important events in history. Each person is trying to make a specific set of events unfold by causing paradoxes in the timeline and "patching" paradoxes with your own missions' alternate history requirements, all while preventing your opponents from achieving their objectives. </p>

        <h4>My review:</h4>
        <p>This is a fantastic party game that can be played over and over. It has several expansions that lengthen the timeline even further. The expansions can all be combined to create one full timeline which is an absolute blast to play. Rating: 7.5/10</p>
