        <h4>My review:</h4>
        <p>This is one of my favorite games as it is not only wonderfully detailed and high quality but it is also a blast to play with friends and family. It has a bit of a learning curve but once mastered this game is quite easy to play. The game has a lot of replayability since there are many sector tiles that are randomly chosen to expand the map as well as, the diverse selection of ships, mission cards, and abilities. Rating: 9.5/10</p>
